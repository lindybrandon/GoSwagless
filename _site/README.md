### What is #GoSwagless? ###
The GoSwagless concept is a simple but powerful one – use the budget and resources that your company would normally spend on giveaway items to support a nonprofit. 

### Why #GoSwagless ###
The decision to #GoSWAGLESS at one, some, or all of your company events is - of course - up to your team and will be based on your goals for each event. Here are some of the benefits: 

* Give and show support to the local area where the event is being held. 
* Contribute to causes that your company is passionate about supporting.
* Raise awareness for a particular issues or mission.
* Engage visitors to your table, booth, or stage by providing a low barrier to entry to share in support of the cause.
* Reduce waste (packaging, discarded giveaways, etc.) at events.

### Want to #GoSwagless? ###
#### Budget ####
Knowing your budget in an important first step. Here are a few considerations:
* If your organization already has a set budget for giveaways, you can easily calculate how much you want to donate.  Ex. We’re going to dedicate 40% of the merchandise budget to the GoSwagless program this year. 
* If you don’t have a predetermined swag budget for the year, you can determine your budget in a number of ways:
  * Create an approximate yearly budget for swag and determine what percent you want to dedicate to nonprofit support. 
  * Determine the budget for GoSwagless on a per-event basis. 

#### Event Calendar ####
Knowing the number and scale of events in advance makes it easier to plan and budget. Compile a list of events that you know your team will be attending and determine which events where you would like to #GoSwagless so you can communicate with the nonprofits and plan creative and content for the event. Other considerations include:
* How big is the event? 
* How many attendees are expected?
* Where is the event? 
* Does your company have relationships with nonprofits in that area?

#### Working with Nonprofits ####
To start, identify the areas or causes that align with the mission of your company or team. For example:
* Diversity in the Workplace
* Tech Education
* Disaster Relief
* Medical Research

Once you have defined these areas with your team, research nonprofit organizations that support your cause(s). If your company doesn’t have a team dedicated to community affairs, here are a few questions to take into account as you begin your research:
* How long has this nonprofit been in operation?
* Do they have their financials posted on their website?
* How do they engage with the community?
* Are there volunteer opportunities for you company?
You can also use [GuideStar](http://www.guidestar.org/) – a great source of information on nonprofit organizations. 

If your company has a community affairs and/or grant-making team, they can help: 
* Identify and introduce you to nonprofits your company already has a relationship with.
* Review nonprofits in the local areas where you are participating in events.
* Determine a good budget for new or existing programs.

### Event Planning ###

#### Event Engagement ####
There are many ways that your visitors can engage with the GoSwagless program during the event. Here are a few methods:  
* Voting. If you are supporting more than one nonprofit at you event, you can have participants vote for the nonprofit that they would like to support. The donation can then be split along the same ratio as the voting results. Voting mechanisms can include:
  * Placing stickers on a board listing the nonprofits. 
  * Placing tokens into clear plastic boxes on a board listing the nonprofits. (See below) 
  * Creating a Twitter or Facebook poll on your company’s social account.
  * Displaying a digital survey on a touch screen or tablet.
* Thought Board. This can be displayed at your booth or another location at the event and allows visitors to post (markers, stickie notes, etc.) responses to questions related to the GoSwagless program. 

#### Content & Creative ####
* There are various types of content that you can create to support your GoSwagless campaign before, during, and after the events:
  * Articles and/or blog posts about the nonprofits and programs that you’re supporting.
  * Posters and banners (digital or print) with information about the nonprofits.
  * Social posts (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).

* You’ll need to gather several assets from the nonprofit(s) to get started:
  * High quality logo file.
  * Brief description of their mission.

### Sample FAQs ###
Here are some questions that you may want to have ready responses for at the events where you #GoSwagless:

  * The GoSwagless concept is a simple but powerful one – use the budget and resources that your company would normally spend on giveaways items to support a nonprofit. 
* Why isn’t your company doing this at all your events?
* Why did you spend money on posters and stickers? Isn’t a sticker considered swag?
  * Part of any successful movement is communication, and these posters and stickers are a tool to help us do just that. We’re hoping that by shedding light on this movement and the nonprofits, we can have an impact beyond just this event (i.e. volunteering, personal donations, etc.). We also kept costs low, so we could give more.
* Can I pay for the sticker or donate more money?
  * We’re not accepting donations at the event, but please visit the participating nonprofits websites for more opportunities to give back.
* Why only $XXX? Surely, you can afford more?
  * We took our pre-approved swag budget and decided to donate it— that way we can give back to our community and still accomplish our goals. Our company has other giving programs, too. You can learn more here: _____.

  * We’re not currently setup to make donations by name, but it’s something we may explore for future events.
