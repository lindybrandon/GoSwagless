### What is #GoSwagless? ###
The GoSwagless concept is a simple but powerful one â€“ use the budget and resources that your company would normally spend on giveaway items to support a nonprofit. 

### Why #GoSwagless ###
The decision to #GoSWAGLESS at one, some, or all of your company events is - of course - up to your team and will be based on your goals for each event. Here are some of the benefits: 

* Give and show support to the local area where the event is being held. 
* Contribute to causes that your company is passionate about supporting.
* Raise awareness for a particular issues or mission.
* Engage visitors to your table, booth, or stage by providing a low barrier to entry to share in support of the cause.
* Reduce waste (packaging, discarded giveaways, etc.) at events.
