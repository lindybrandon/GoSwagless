### Budget ###
Knowing your budget in an important first step. Here are a few considerations:
* If your organization already has a set budget for giveaways, you can easily calculate how much you want to donate.  Ex. We’re going to dedicate 40% of the merchandise budget to the GoSwagless program this year. 
* If you don’t have a predetermined swag budget for the year, you can determine your budget in a number of ways:
  * Create an approximate yearly budget for swag and determine what percent you want to dedicate to nonprofit support. 
  * Determine the budget for GoSwagless on a per-event basis. 

### Event Calendar ###
Knowing the number and scale of events in advance makes it easier to plan and budget. Compile a list of events that you know your team will be attending and determine which events where you would like to #GoSwagless so you can communicate with the nonprofits and plan creative and content for the event. Other considerations include:
* How big is the event? 
* How many attendees are expected?
* Where is the event? 
* Does your company have relationships with nonprofits in that area?

### Working with Nonprofits ###
To start, identify the areas or causes that align with the mission of your company or team. For example:
* Diversity in the Workplace
* Tech Education
* Disaster Relief
* Medical Research

Once you have defined these areas with your team, research nonprofit organizations that support your cause(s). If your company doesn’t have a team dedicated to community affairs, here are a few questions to take into account as you begin your research:
* How long has this nonprofit been in operation?
* Do they have their financials posted on their website?
* How do they engage with the community?
* Are there volunteer opportunities for you company?
You can also use [GuideStar](http://www.guidestar.org/) – a great source of information on nonprofit organizations. 

If your company has a community affairs and/or grant-making team, they can help: 
* Identify and introduce you to nonprofits your company already has a relationship with.
* Review nonprofits in the local areas where you are participating in events.
* Determine a good budget for new or existing programs.
