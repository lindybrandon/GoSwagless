### Event Engagement ###
There are many ways that your visitors can engage with the GoSwagless program during the event. Here are a few methods:  
* Voting. If you are supporting more than one nonprofit at you event, you can have participants vote for the nonprofit that they would like to support. The donation can then be split along the same ratio as the voting results. Voting mechanisms can include:
  * Placing stickers on a board listing the nonprofits. 
  * Placing tokens into clear plastic boxes on a board listing the nonprofits. (See below) 
  * Creating a Twitter or Facebook poll on your company’s social account.
  * Displaying a digital survey on a touch screen or tablet.
* Thought Board. This can be displayed at your booth or another location at the event and allows visitors to post (markers, stickie notes, etc.) responses to questions related to the GoSwagless program. 

### Content & Creative ###
* There are various types of content that you can create to support your GoSwagless campaign before, during, and after the events:
  * Articles and/or blog posts about the nonprofits and programs that you’re supporting.
  * Posters and banners (digital or print) with information about the nonprofits.
  * Social posts (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).

* You’ll need to gather several assets from the nonprofit(s) to get started:

#### Sample FAQs ####
Here are some questions that you may want to have ready responses for at the events where you #GoSwagless: 

* What is GoSwagless? (What does it mean? What’s in it for your company? Why did you decide to start doing this?)
  * The GoSwagless concept is a simple but powerful one – use the budget and resources that your company would normally spend on giveaways items to support a nonprofit. 
* Why isn’t your company doing this at all your events?
* Why did you spend money on posters and stickers? Isn’t a sticker considered swag?
  * Part of any successful movement is communication, and these posters and stickers are a tool to help us do just that. We’re hoping that by shedding light on this movement and the nonprofits, we can have an impact beyond just this event (i.e. volunteering, personal donations, etc.). We also kept costs low, so we could give more.
* Can I pay for the sticker or donate more money?
  * We’re not accepting donations at the event, but please visit the participating nonprofits websites for more opportunities to give back.
* Why only $XXX? Surely, you can afford more?
  * We took our pre-approved swag budget and decided to donate it— that way we can give back to our community and still accomplish our goals. Our company has other giving programs, too. You can learn more here: _____.
* Are you just doing this to spend less?
  * We would have spent this amount on swag regardless.
* But I like the swag. Can you still send me swag?
  * We’ve committed to giving back and making a difference in our community through this movement. We used our entire event swag budget on GoSwagless, which means we haven’t ordered swag beyond the stickers. Why would you prefer swag? If we went back to swag, what do you like?
* Will you donate money under my name?
  * We’re not currently setup to make donations by name, but it’s something we may explore for future events.
* Will you donate even if I don’t vote?
  * Yes, we will. We’d like your help on selecting how the money gets divided, as knowing our community’s point-of-view is important to us.
* What happens if no one votes?
  * If no one votes, we’ll split the donation equally.
* How much have you donated so far?
